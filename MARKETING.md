## Press Release / Blog Post

### WCAG Master Launches: Automated Web Accessibility Compliance in Minutes, Not Days

**[City, Date]** - WCAG Master, a new web-based tool for automated WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance, is now available to developers and designers worldwide. The platform transforms inaccessible website code into compliant, optimized HTML/CSS/JavaScript in seconds using AI-powered analysis and automated fixes.

**The Challenge**
Web accessibility compliance is a legal requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and a moral imperative - yet 98% of the top 1 million websites fail basic accessibility tests according to WebAIM. Manual WCAG audits are expensive ($5,000-$50,000) and time-consuming (weeks to months), putting accessible web design out of reach for many developers and small businesses.

**The Solution**
WCAG Master automates the most common accessibility fixes:

- **Semantic HTML**: Converts `<div>` soup into proper `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` elements
- **Color Contrast**: Analyzes stylesheets (including CSS variables) and suggests AA/AAA compliant color combinations
- **ARIA Attributes**: Adds labels, roles, and descriptions to interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensures all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible
- **Image Alt Text**: Generates descriptive alt text based on filenames and context

**How It Works**
1. Developers upload HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files
2. The analyzer runs 12+ WCAG 2.1 Level AA checks
3. Automated fixes are applied to the code
4. Users can refine with natural language feedback ("improve mobile accessibility")
5. Download optimized code + full project history as ZIP

**Technical Innovation**
Unlike browser-based accessibility checkers that only highlight problems, WCAG Master actually fixes the code:

- **Shared Analyzer Architecture**: Same WCAG engine runs in browser and serverless edge functions
- **CSS Parser**: Analyzes external stylesheets and CSS custom properties for accurate contrast detection
- **Iterative Refinement**: Users provide feedback and the analyzer adapts (up to 3 iterations per project)
- **Version Control**: All iterations are saved with ratings and feedback for quality tracking

**Pricing & Availability**
WCAG Master is available now at [URL] with a free tier:
- 1 project per day
- 3 refinements per project
- Full feature access

Pro tier (coming Q1 2026) will offer unlimited projects, priority processing, and advanced features.

**About WCAG Master**
WCAG Master was created to democratize web accessibility and help developers ship inclusive products faster. The platform is built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase, with a custom WCAG 2.1 analyzer designed for both accuracy and speed.
